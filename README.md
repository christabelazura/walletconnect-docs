# WalletConnect v1.x.x

## Introduction

WalletConnect is an open protocol to communicate securely between Wallets and Dapps (Web3 Apps). The protocol establishes a remote connection between two apps and/or devices using a Bridge server to relay payloads. These payloads are symmetrically encrypted through a shared key between the two peers. The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this connection request. It also includes an optional Push server to allow Native applications to notify the user of incoming payloads for established connections.

## Getting Started

Currently the WalletConnect protocol has references implementations written in Typescript for the Client (browser/react-native/nodejs), the Bridge Server and the Push server.
